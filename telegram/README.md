3. Enter a username for your bot. This must end in `bot`.
4. Once done the BotFather will give you an access token to use.

## Runing the bot

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed by entering `npm install`
2. `TELEGRAM_TOKEN={your token from the BotFather} node index.js`
3. Start chatting with your new bot.
